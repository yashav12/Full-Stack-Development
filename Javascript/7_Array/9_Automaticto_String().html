<!-- 9. Automatic toString() Conversion

👉 Arrays automatically become strings when printed.
Real Life Example: Showing fruits as a shopping list. 
👉 Practical Example:

Imagine writing your own name on a paper → you did it explicitly.

Someone else writing your name automatically for you when asked → implicit.

Both results are the same, but one is done by you, the other by the system.-->
