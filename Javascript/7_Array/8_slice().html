<!-- 🔹 What is slice()?

The slice() method in JavaScript is used to copy a portion of an array into a new array without changing the original array.

🔹 Syntax
array.slice(start, end)


start → The index where the copy begins (included).

end → The index where the copy ends (not included).

If end is not given, it slices till the end of array.

Indexing starts from 0. -->
